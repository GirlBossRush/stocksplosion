# Summary

Hello!

Stocksplosion makes financial decisions simple.
My goal was to show as much data to the user as possible and let them decide how to filter.
A user can find a stock by name or symbol and act without leaving the keyboard!
There's a sweet spot between visual data and mental maps that I think we've lost over time, I'd love to expand the app with Vim-like shortcuts, but maybe next time :)

In a second iteration I'd also like to clarify the price ranges.
The scale of the data can be cleaner with a more detailed graph.

# Tooling

Created with React, Webpack, and Babel, Stocksplosion is built to satisfy the initial requirements and be expanded for future changes.
I like React because it's functional but pragmatic enough to be productive.
The ecosystem also encourages immutability and composition which keeps complexity from growing out of hand.
Given the size of this iteration I've decided not to include a Flux framework.
I've limited mutable state since the pattern encourage many simple components.

# Time

I've spent two 8 hour sessions on this submission (150/hr, $2,400).
The app reached 60% completion within the first session with little interruption.
Missing pieces were stubbed with a placeholder of how I envisioned they would fit, then filled in.
I estimate a quarter of the time could be shaved off with design mockups.

I had a lot fun, let me know if you'd like anything clarified.

Cheers!
